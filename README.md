# Uni_Brickbreaker
A game project we had to implement in our first year of the course.

We were supplied most of the code except it did not work correctly, and so we had code it to work as well as extending the games functionality.

Please read the report for further information of what I did.

If you would like to run the game then open the Brickbreaker project into eclipse java.
